# Angublog (Work in Progress)

Blog made in a [DIO](https://www.dio.me) Bootcamp with its design inspired in a [Dwinaman's design](https://dribbble.com/shots/18089191-Blog-Layout).

## Built with

- <strong>HTML5, CSS3</strong>: Provides structure and styling for the app.
    - <strong><abbr title="Block Element Modifier">BEM</abbr></strong>: CSS methodology for easier understanding of the styling hierarchy.
- <strong>JavaScript + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)</strong>: JS allows user interaction with the app and TS makes the code type-safe, less prone to bugs.
- <strong>[Angular](https://angular.io/)</strong>: Turns App into a SPA, providing a smoother user experience. Development is easier by treating code as components, smaller pieces of code that can be reused and don't affect unrelated ones.
